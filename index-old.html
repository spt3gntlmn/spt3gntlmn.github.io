				<p>
					I am Samuel Taylor. I live a very exciting life. The main and most prominent aspect of my life is the great influence of
					God in my life. The central theme is my commitment to follow His will totally in my life. Without God as the central
					theme in my life purpose would vanish and meaning to life would be non existent. Therefore, first and foremost, God's
					will must be adhered to and I must seek Him earnestly.
				</p>
				<p>
					After that, I must provide for myself. This means procuring sound and sustainable employment. This is a must because I must
					eat, have a place to sleep, and well, you know, provide for myself (as well as help others). This brings me to The Coding
					Boot Camp here at UNC Charlotte. I have long wanted and felt I needed to be building websites. This goes back twenty
					plus years. I now have that opportunity. I feel in many ways that this is the last of the 'great doors' to be knocked
					down. What I intend to learn here transcends coding. Sure, learning coding is important, however, learning that I can
					do anything I set my mind to is of far greater value. I don't merely want to learn how to code, I want to excel at it.
					I want to do so well that my character itself is refined in the process.
